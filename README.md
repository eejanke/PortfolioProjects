# About Me

Data analysis has been a passion of mine ever since I was little and realized data could provide me with answers to my questions. Can a plant grow in a closet? What’s up with the phrase “April showers bring May flowers?” When is the best time for me to study so I can retain the most information possible? I’m glad I can use this passion of mine in my work today. 


I am currently a self-employed consultant working with the Roosevelt School District to support and evaluate their federal grant programs. With me I have brought the use of data and analytics to discover and showcase areas of strength and growth at various sites in the district. I love knowing that my visualizations and dashboards have helped stakeholders really get to know their programs, so they make the most impactful decisions for their communities.
