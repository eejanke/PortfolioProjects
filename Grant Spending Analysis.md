# ESSER III Grant Spending

### Purpose

ESSER III funds were sent to education entities to support education for students during the COVID-19 pandemic. All entities that recieved funds are required to publish spending reports for the public.

Based on the data and criteria given by stakeholders, I created the following report which was published to the district website.
